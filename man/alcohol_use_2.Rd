\description{
Data from Barnes, Farrell, and Banerjee (1994) measuring the relation between
changes in alcohol use and changes in peer pressure to use alcohol in a
sample of 1122 Black and White adolescents tracked from the beginning of
seventh grade through the end of eighth grade.

\note{
Barnes, Farrell, and Banerjee (1994) report a sample of only 699 adolescents;
however, they note that this was an ongoing longitudinal study, which likely
explains the sample size discrepancy with the data used by Singer and Willett
(2003).
