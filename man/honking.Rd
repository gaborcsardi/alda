\description{
A subset of data from Diekmann and colleagues (1996) measuring time to horn
honking in a sample of 57 motorists who were purposefully blocked at a green
light by a Volkswagen Jetta at a busy intersection near the centre of Munich,
West Germany on two busy afternoons (Sunday and Monday) in 1998. Motorists
were followed until they honked their horns or took an alternative action
(beaming or changing lanes).
